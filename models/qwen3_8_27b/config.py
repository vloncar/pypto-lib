"""Qwen3.8-27B configuration, and the tiling the GDN kernels choose.

Model values follow HuggingFace `config.json` and carry its field names, so a
reader can check them against the published config without a translation table.
They were read from `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` and from the safetensors headers of its
first shard; the layer they describe is `model.language_model.layers.N.linear_attn`.

Only the linear-attention block is implemented here. The gated-attention layers,
the MoE-free dense MLP, the vision tower and the MTP layer are model fields for
context, not things this tree builds.
